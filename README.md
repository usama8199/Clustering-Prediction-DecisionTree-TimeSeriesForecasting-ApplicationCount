# Modeling-Prediction-Clustering-ApplicationCount-HackathonWinner

##Overview
1. Deal with missing value in ZONE using Random Forest
2. Cluster the data with the help of state, zone and group
3. Modeling and predicting of application using Decision tree and linear regression and compare them both
4. Also used forecasting to predict Application count for next 3 months


## Problem Statement
Dataset of various loan application counts spread over different
parts of the country. In order to accurately scale their services this company wants to
predict the upcoming count of the number of applications over the next 3 months.

## Data sets
APPLIED_DATE,GROUP,BRANCH_ID,STATE,ZONE,APPLICATION_COUNT
